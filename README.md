## Description

This project aims to build a robust API for a social network web application. Inspired by the rapid growth and the diverse needs of social media startups, the focus is on delivering an API that leverages a NoSQL database. This approach is chosen to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently. The project uses Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose ODM for data modeling.

- **Motivation**: The need for high-performing and scalable social networks.
- **Purpose**: To provide an efficient backend solution for social media applications.
- **Problem Solved**: Managing large, unstructured datasets with speed and flexibility.
- **Learning Outcome**: Gained insights into NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB, and honed skills in Express.js and Mongoose.
